Spec and rendering components for the Liturgical Document Format (LDF) used by Venite.app.

Ultimately, this will provide:
1. **Liturgical Document Format** (LDF): an open JSON-based document format capable of representing almost any worship bulletin, psalm, prayer, or other liturgical document
2. **Components**: a set of web components that
  - can be embedded in any webpage or HTML-based app to display a liturgical document; currently support IE11 and all modern browsers (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, etc.)
  - can collaboratively edit any liturgical document
3. **An app** that provides a collaborative editor to work on documents together, based on Operational Transformation.

This is very much a work in progress, and consists of a complete rewrite of the app found at www.venite.app.
