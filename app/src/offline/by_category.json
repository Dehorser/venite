Make these words more than words, and give me the Spirit of Jesus."],"label":"  In the Morning","category":["Prayers and Thanksgivings","Prayers","Prayers for use by a Sick Person"," In the Morning"],"slug":"prayers-8-3","type":"text","sharing":{"privacy":"public","status":"published","owner":"ikvC2kTwM0MhmiqfMOi2fFZynJr2","collaborators":[],"organization":"venite"},"style":"prayer"},{"value":["O God our Father, whose Son forgave his enemies while he was suffering shame and death: Strengthen those who suffer for the sake of conscience; when they are accused, save them from speaking in hate; when they are rejected, save them from bitterness; when they are imprisoned, save them from despair; and to us your servants, give grace to respect their witness and to discern the truth, that our society may be cleansed and strengthened.
