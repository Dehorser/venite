Finally we commend to thy fatherly goodness all those, who are any ways afflicted or distressed in mind, body, or estate; [* %especially those for whom our prayers are desired;%] that it may please thee to comfort and relieve them, according to their several necessities, giving them patience under their sufferings, and a happy issue out of all their afflictions.
