are you, O Lord our God,\n\tthe God of our fathers,\nyou turn the shadow of death into the morning,\n\tand shine upon the face of the earth.\nYou separate darkness from the face of the light,\n\tyou cause the night to pass, and bring on the day.\nYou give light to my eyes,\n\tlest I sleep in death.\nYou rescue me from terror by night,\n\tfrom the plague that stalks in the darkness.\nYou drive away sleep from my eyes,\n\tand wipe slumber from my eyelids.\nThe evening and morning praise you as they pass.\n\tI lay down, and slept, and arose,\n\tBecause you, O Lord, have sustained me in hope.\nI arose, and I looked,\n\tand my sleep became sweet to me.\nBlot out as a cloud all my transgressions,\n\tthat I might spend this day soberly, purely, and honestly.\nCount me worthy to guard this day against sin.\nSupport me when I fall, lift me up when I have fallen,\n\tso that I may never harden my heart in bitterness,\n\tor in temptation, or in the deceit of any sin.\nRescue me today from the snare of the hunter,\n\tfrom disordered thoughts,\n\tfrom the arrow that flies by day,\n\tfrom any mischance,\n\tfrom the mid-day demon.\nKeep me from my evil this day;\n\tfrom my evil keep me.\nLet not my days be consumed in vanity,\n\tmy years in wretchedness.\nOne day tells its tale to another;\n\tmay this day teach yesterday some knowledge or practice.\nLet me hear of your loving-kindness in the morning;\n\tfor I put my trust in you.\nTeach me the way in which I should walk,\n\tfor I lift up my soul to you.\nDeliver me from my enemies, O Lord,\n\tfor I flee to you for refuge.\nTeach me to do your will,\n\tfor you are my God.\nLet your good Spirit lead me\n\ton level ground.\nRevive me, O Lord, for your name’s sake;\n\tin your righteousness, bring me out of trouble.\nPut away empty thoughts from my soul,\n\tbut inspire me with those good things\n\tthat are pleasant in your sight.\nTurn away my eyes, that they may not see vain things,\nLet my eyes look straight ahead,\n\tand let my vision point toward righteousness.\nFence in my ears with thorns,\n\tso they pay no attention to malformed thoughts.\nIn the morning, set my ears to hear,\n\tand open my ears to the teaching of your words.\nSet a watch before my mouth, O Lord,\nand guard the doors of my lips,\n\tlet my word be seasoned with salt,\n\t\tthat I may give grace to those who hear.\nLet not my work be for grief,\n\tor any stumbling of heart.\nLet my work be something you remember as goodness, O Lord,\n\tand spare me, according to the greatness of your mercy."]}]}],"date_modified":{"seconds":1615428734,"nanoseconds":315000000},"date_created":{"nanoseconds":91000000,"seconds":1614982458},"category":[],"sharing":{"collaborators":[],"status":"draft","privacy":"organization","organization":"stjohnscharlestown","owner":"xanBxGZ8EvU2PbeLindaBeerYRB2"},"id":"IfHZlDsZO7D0oBFr6FS5","language":"en"}
